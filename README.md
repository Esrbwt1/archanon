## 🧭 Project Philosophy

### **"True General Intelligence Must Be Safe, Autonomous, and Open—By Design, Not Afterthought."**

ARCHANON is not just a technical project. It is a philosophical, epistemological, and engineering quest to create Real-True-Full AGI. We are building a new cognitive substrate that is:

*   **Modular**, not monolithic
*   **Grounded**, not merely statistical
*   **Causal**, not correlation-bound
*   **Self-aware**, not opaque
*   **Corrigible**, not self-serving
*   **Open**, not proprietary

This repository contains the complete source code, documentation, and research for the ARCHANON project.

## 🗺️ The Four-Phase Roadmap

The project is broken into four distinct, sequential research phases.

*   **🧠 PHASE 1 — Cognitive Kernel:** Build the minimal *cognitive substrate* capable of causal reasoning, memory formation, and metacognitive monitoring.
*   **🌍 PHASE 2 — Grounded Learning & Curriculum:** Enable the Kernel to **learn about the world** through a structured, multi-modal curriculum.
*   **🤝 PHASE 3 — Emergent Capabilities & Theory of Mind:** Foster **creative, emotional, and social reasoning abilities** in multi-agent simulations.
*   **🚀 PHASE 4 — Sandbox Autonomy & Ambitious Research:** Test the fully autonomous system against a **grand challenge** in a secure, air-gapped sandbox.

## 🛡️ Safety & Alignment by Design

Safety is not a feature; it is the foundation. Our architecture is built on non-negotiable principles:

| Principle          | Implementation Mechanism                                       |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Value Alignment**  | Constitutional AI + human feedback loop                        |
| **Corrigibility**    | Immutable shutdown-respecting core utility                     |
| **Interpretability** | Chain-of-Consciousness logging for full logical transparency |
| **Containment**      | Air-gapped sandbox simulation during all training & testing    |

## 🤝 How to Contribute

This is an open research project. The best way to contribute at this early stage is to review the architecture, participate in discussions, and challenge our assumptions.
